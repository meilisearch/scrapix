Comté, the crown jewel of French mountain cheeses, has been crafted in the Jura mountains for over a thousand years. This hard cheese, made from unpasteurized cow's milk, represents the perfect harmony between traditional craftsmanship and its alpine terroir. Each wheel of Comté tells the story of its origin, from the diverse flora that the Montbéliarde cows graze upon to the expertise of the local fruitières (cheese makers) who transform the milk into this exceptional cheese.

The production of Comté is a testament to community cooperation and time-honored methods. The process begins with fresh milk from local farms, which must be processed within 24 hours of milking. The cheese then undergoes a careful aging process in special caves, lasting anywhere from 4 to 24 months or more. During this time, the cheese develops its complex flavor profile and distinctive texture, watched over by skilled affineurs who carefully monitor each wheel's development.

## The Taste of Tradition

The flavor of Comté is as varied as the landscapes where it originates. Young Comté offers subtle, buttery notes with hints of fresh nuts and sweet milk. As it ages, it develops more pronounced flavors - caramel, roasted nuts, and subtle spices emerge, sometimes accompanied by crystalline protein clusters that provide a pleasant crunch. The texture evolves from smooth and pliable to firmer and more granular, while maintaining its characteristic melt-in-your-mouth quality.

Each wheel of Comté is unique, influenced by factors such as season, terrain, and aging conditions. This diversity is celebrated through a sophisticated tasting system that identifies over 80 distinct flavor notes, making Comté one of the most complex and nuanced cheeses in the world. Whether enjoyed on its own, melted in traditional dishes like fondue, or paired with a glass of Jura wine, Comté continues to captivate cheese enthusiasts and represent the finest in French cheese-making tradition.
