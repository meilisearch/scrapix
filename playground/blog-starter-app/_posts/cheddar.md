Cheddar cheese, with its distinctive sharp flavor and crumbly texture, has earned its place as Britain's most beloved cheese and one of the most widely produced cheeses in the world. Originally crafted in the Somerset village of Cheddar, this cheese's history dates back to at least the 12th century, when the unique caves of the Cheddar Gorge provided the perfect environment for aging.

The traditional process of making Cheddar involves a technique known as "cheddaring," where slabs of curds are stacked and turned repeatedly to expel whey and develop the characteristic texture. This process, combined with careful aging, creates Cheddar's signature firm, dense structure and complex flavor profile. Traditional artisanal Cheddar can be aged anywhere from a few months to several years, with longer aging producing stronger, more complex flavors and often developing delightful calcium lactate crystals that add a pleasant crunch.

## The Many Faces of Cheddar

From mild to extra sharp, from traditional clothbound wheels to contemporary varieties, Cheddar comes in many forms. Young Cheddar offers a mild, buttery flavor with subtle notes of fresh milk, while aged versions develop intense, savory characteristics with hints of caramel, nuts, and even a slight earthiness. The color can range from ivory white to deep orange, though the orange hue comes from the addition of annatto, a natural food coloring that doesn't affect the taste.

Today, while industrial production dominates the market, artisanal cheesemakers in Somerset and beyond continue to craft traditional Cheddar using time-honored methods. These authentic farmhouse Cheddars offer a taste of history and demonstrate why this cheese has maintained its popularity for centuries. Whether melted in a classic Welsh rarebit, grated over a shepherd's pie, or enjoyed on its own with a glass of robust red wine, Cheddar remains a testament to the enduring appeal of well-crafted cheese.
